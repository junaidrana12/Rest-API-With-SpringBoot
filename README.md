# Rest-API-With-SpringBoot
# 🛠️ Spring Boot REST API Project
This project demonstrates how to create a simple RESTful API using Spring Boot. The API supports basic CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and has been tested using Postman.

# 📘 About REST API
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate over the web using standard HTTP methods like:

GET – to retrieve data

POST – to create new data

PUT – to update existing data

DELETE – to remove data

REST APIs follow specific principles that make them lightweight, scalable, and easy to use. They typically use JSON format for sending and receiving data.

In this project, the REST API is built using Spring Boot, which simplifies the development of Java-based web applications. The API exposes endpoints that can be accessed by clients such as web apps, mobile apps, or tools like Postman for testing.
